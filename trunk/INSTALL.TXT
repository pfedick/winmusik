WinMusik 3 - Installation
=========================

This installation guide describes how to compile WinMusik on a Unix
compatible operation system from sourcecode. If that's not what you want,
please check https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmusik/files/client/
if there is a precompiled package for your operating system. 


Prerequirements
===============

You have to install the following packages:
	- GCC, version 4.2 or higher
	- QT, version 4.8.0 or higher (including Qt5)
	- zlib (developer package)
	- bzip2 (developer package)
	- pcre (developer package)
	- openssl (developer package)
	- libcurl (developer package)
	- libmcrypt (developer package)
	- iconv (only if you have to import files from old WinMusik version 2.x)
	- libcdio (developer package)



Configure and compile
=====================

WinMusik comes with an Autoconf configure-Skript. In a perfect world, you
can simply type

	./configure

and the script will finds everything automatically. In practice, it probably
will not, and you have to specify some paths manually. See 

	configure --help=recursive
	
for a description of all parameters.

On a RedHat 6 based Linux or Ubuntu 12.04, the following configure will work:

	./configure --with-pcre=/usr --with-libiconv-prefix \
	--with-nasm --with-libmcrypt-prefix --with-png --with-jpeg \
	--with-libcurl
	
On FreeBSD, you can use this one:
	./configure --with-pcre=/usr/local --with-openssl=/usr \
	--with-libiconv-prefix=/usr/local --with-nasm --with-jpeg --with-png \
	--with-libmcrypt-prefix=/usr/local --with-libcurl=/usr/local


You should also specify the base directory for the installation with
"--prefix=", it defaults to "/usr/local"


Then type

	make
	make install
